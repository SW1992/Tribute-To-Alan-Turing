      <blockquote>
      <h3> “The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.”
      <br> <br> - Time magazine, 100 People of the 20th Century </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <h3>
      “Alan Turing’s life story reads as if it were a tragic fiction. A great mind, an athlete, an eccentric, a hero of the Second World War, father of computer science and of artificial intelligence, a code breaker and, finally, a victim of prejudice.  To me his short life encapsulates many of the great changes of the 20th century.” <br> <br> - Dr. John Graham Cumming, British Programmer & Writer </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <h3> "The things that he contributed to computer science weren’t the things that just happened to be true in one particular year or one particular decade, they were the things that are fundamentally true so they are always going to be with us, in the same way as things that Galileo and Newton contributed to physics are always going to be with us.” <br> <br> - Dr. Alma Whitten,
      Google, Lead Privacy Engineer </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <h3>
      "Turing was a quite brilliant mathematician, most famous for his work on breaking the German Enigma codes. It is no exaggeration to say that, without his outstanding contribution, the history of the Second World War could have been very different. He truly was one of those individuals we can point to whose unique contribution helped to turn the tide of war. The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely. "
      <br> <br> - Gordon Brown, Former British Primeminster </h3>
